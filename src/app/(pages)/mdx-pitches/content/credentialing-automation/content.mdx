## Option 1: Email-to-PDF Workflow

Forward payer credentialing emails to your dedicated address and receive pre-filled PDFs ready for review in minutes. Our AI-powered system uses OpenAI to identify providers and AWS Textract to analyze form fields, then automatically pulls data from your Google Sheets and encrypted storage to generate editable PDFs. Provider data is managed through a comprehensive spreadsheet template with SSNs encrypted using AES-256 on your self-hosted n8n server.

### How It Works

1. **Email arrives** — Forward credentialing form to dedicated address and reference providers required for form → workflow auto-triggers
2. **AI processes form** — Identifies providers, analyzes fields, pulls data, fills PDF
3. **Review & approve** — Receive pre-filled PDF → quick review → reply "APPROVED"
4. **Edit if Needed** - Edit PDF manually and return for flattening
5. **Receive finalized PDF** and forward to credentialing partners

### Ongoing Changes to Provider Details

Complete through Google Sheets/Excel and when needed, via developer support to edit encrypted SSN's and other sensitive PII.

### Security

- AES-256 encrypted SSN storage on self-hosted n8n
- TLS email encryption

- Complete audit trail

### Ongoing Costs:
