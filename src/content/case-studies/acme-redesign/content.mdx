# Project Overview

Acme Corporation approached us with a legacy website that hadn't been updated in over five years. Their existing site was built on outdated technology, had poor mobile responsiveness, and wasn't converting visitors effectively.

## The Challenge

The main challenges we faced included:

- **Legacy Technology Stack**: Built on an outdated CMS with limited flexibility
- **Poor Mobile Experience**: Over 60% of traffic was mobile, but the site wasn't responsive
- **Low Conversion Rates**: Less than 2% conversion rate on key landing pages
- **Slow Performance**: Page load times averaging 6+ seconds

## Our Approach

We took a comprehensive approach to redesigning their digital presence:

### Research & Discovery

Before touching any code, we conducted extensive research to understand Acme's users and business goals. This included:

- User interviews with existing customers
- Analytics deep-dive to understand user behavior
- Competitive analysis of industry leaders
- Stakeholder workshops to align on objectives

### Design System Development

We created a comprehensive design system that would scale across all of Acme's digital touchpoints:

- **Typography**: Custom font pairing for improved readability
- **Color Palette**: Accessible colors that reinforce brand identity
- **Component Library**: Reusable components for consistency
- **Responsive Grid**: Flexible layout system for all devices

## Technical Implementation

The new website was built using modern technologies:

- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and optimal performance
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent styling and faster development
- **Sanity CMS**: For easy content management

## Results

The redesigned website exceeded all expectations:

> "The new website has completely transformed our online presence. We're seeing conversion rates we never thought possible, and our team loves how easy it is to manage content."

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several key principles:

1. **User research is invaluable**: Understanding real user needs led to better design decisions
2. **Performance matters**: Fast loading times directly impact conversion rates  
3. **Mobile-first design**: With mobile traffic dominating, mobile experience is critical
4. **Content strategy**: Good content architecture makes or breaks user experience

The success of this project has led to an ongoing partnership with Acme Corporation, and we continue to support their digital initiatives across multiple channels.
